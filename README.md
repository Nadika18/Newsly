## Building the project

- Clone the project

- Install flutter from [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

- Either [set up an emulator](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows#set-up-the-android-emulator) or [set up your android phone (enable USB debugging)](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows#set-up-the-android-emulator) to run the app.

- If you'd also like to run the backend locally (not recommended, because you'd need to populate the news on your own), check out [this repo](https://github.com/ErSauravAdhikari/Newsly).

- If you do set up your own repo, don't forget to change 'newsly.asaurav.com.np' to 'localhost:8000' in the file `/lib/models/1.dart`.
